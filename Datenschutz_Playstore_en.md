**Terms of use of the Vine Leaf Disease App and AI**

Use of the app implies that you agree to the following terms of use. Therefore, please read them carefully. If you do not agree, do not install the app or delete it from your Android system.

**1. General**

The provider of the app is INFOrmAtIc Teens, consisting of the students Maria-Theresa Licka and Mario Schweikert (hereinafter referred to as &quot;INFOrmAtIc Teens&quot;, https://matheli.github.io/Vine-leaf-diseases-and-AI/) as part of a Jugend forscht project in 2021 [(](https://deref-gmx.net/mail/client/8qGT3DpcZEc/dereferrer/?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fprotection.retarus.com%2Fv1%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.jugend-forscht.de%26c%3D3ii9Xaz%26r%3D6JVYuMSXvl3kHJexS77cW4%26k%3D7s1%26s%3D2fRBzZ8nc8ENcGR0aksXoSEfoaZoTANzsNHLgzcVxsA)https://www.jugend-forscht.de).

The project as a whole is supervised by the Jugend forscht AG in Neustadt an der Weinstraße [(](https://deref-gmx.net/mail/client/wFPTf_GMKPU/dereferrer/?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fprotection.retarus.com%2Fv1%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fjf-nw.de%252F%26c%3D3ii9Xaz%26r%3D1qGnrEqr9jADuA0J67EgkR%26k%3D7s1%26s%3D1IT9etJfp1lh1wrqNBinVebbhYYFf6gdeEdZpyL5uLV)https://jf-nw.de/).

**2. How the app works**

This app tries to detect leaf diseases on grapevines using artificial intelligence. To do this, the &quot;diseased&quot; leaf is photographed and the image is then evaluated using artificial intelligence (AI). The app is currently available free of charge in the Google Play Store and IOS Store for an audience interested in artificial intelligence / vine leaf diseases to try out experimentally. It is not impossible that the app is wrong in its classification.

**3. Warranty and liability**

INFOrmAtIc Teens makes no warranties as to the availability, reliability, functionality or suitability of the app for your purposes. We are not liable for any damages, in particular we do not accept any responsibility for misdiagnosis. The app is currently only intended and provided for use in an experimental environment at pupil / student level.

**Privacy Policy for the Vine Leaf Disease App**

**1. information on the collection of personal data**

We provide you with the mobile app &quot;Vine Leaf Disease&quot;, which you can download to your mobile device free of charge. In the following, we inform you about the collection of personal data when using our mobile app. Personal data is all data that can be related to you personally, e.g. name, address, e-mail addresses, user behaviour.

**2. person in charge**

The responsible party within the meaning of Art. 4 (7) DS-GVO is INFOrmAtIc Teens GbR, consisting of Ms Maria-Theresa Licka and Mr Mario Schweikert, c/o Jugend forscht AG, Alter Viehberg 1, 67434 Neustadt an der Weinstraße, informaticteens@gmail.com.

INFOrmAtIc Teens GbR is currently not legally obliged to appoint a data protection officer.

**3. contact by e-mail**

When you contact us by e-mail, your e-mail address and, if provided by you, further contact data, such as your name, address and telephone number, are stored in order to respond to your request. We delete the data accruing in this context after storage is no longer necessary or - in the case of statutory retention obligations - after there is no longer a statutory retention obligation.

The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO.

**4. functioning and data processing within the Vine Leaf Disease App**

The app tries to detect leaf diseases on grapevines by means of artificial intelligence. To do this, the &quot;sick&quot; leaf is photographed by the app user and the image is then evaluated using artificial intelligence. The app is currently being made available to an audience interested in artificial intelligence / vine leaf diseases for experimental testing.

The app itself has permission on your mobile device to access the exact coordinates, the network, the camera (all camera perspectives) and the memory (gallery and all other data).

The specific permissions can be specified as: Read External Storage, Access Fine Location, Access Coarse Location, Access Networkstate, Internet, Camera and usesCleartextTraffic=True.

The app sends the following data unencrypted to our database at the hoster MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/de-de/cloud). You can access the privacy policy of this web server hoster at the following link: [https:](https://www.mongodb.com/de-de/legal/privacy-policy)//www.mongodb.com/de-de/legal/privacy-policy

The transmitted data are Mongo Documents with:

- Name (always anonymised - field is not filled in with real name)

- Timestamp,

- Coordinates,

- and the name of the suspected leaf disease of the leaf.

These files are stored for the further development and continuous improvement of the AI of the app until they are no longer needed for this purpose. The deletion may therefore only take place after a few years under certain circumstances.

The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO.

**5. IP address, log files and processing of image files**

The IP address of your mobile device is required during transport to the web server and is also stored in the technical log files (so-called log files).

Then the app fetches the image data needed for displaying from the web server alone via unencrypted HTTP get and post (with coordinates) from our private server (Jetson Nano with Python Flaskserver) in order to graphically display the spread of leaf diseases for the user. These are graphical evaluations of data from all app users. The image data can be accessed by any user of the app and via the browser.

Via additional unencrypted API endpoints on our Flaskserver, usage (number of clicks of buttons, number of app opens, number of scans etc.) is stored in our Mongo database via HTTP post with an anonymised unique recognition ID.

**In particular, all images that are analysed in the app, i.e. photographed or loaded via the gallery function, are uploaded unencrypted from your mobile device via HTTP mail to the internet and sent with location and IP address to our web server / MongoDB. We store this image data permanently and use it to create further machine learning models. Only vine leaves should be photographed from your site, i.e. without personal reference, or loaded via the gallery. These files are stored for the further development and continuous improvement of the AI of the app until you are no longer needed for this purpose. It may therefore only be possible to delete them after a few years.**

The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO.

**6. collection of personal data by downloading from the Google Play**  **Store**

When downloading our app, information is already transmitted to the Google Play Store, to our knowledge in particular user name, email address and customer number of your account, time of download, payment information and the individual device identification number. We have no influence on this data collection and are not responsible for it.

Further information on data protection can be found in the data protection notices of the aforementioned Firebase services at https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy.
